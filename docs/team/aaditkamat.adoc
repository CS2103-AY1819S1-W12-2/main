== PROJECT: DebtTracker

== Overview

Debt Tracker is a CLI-based desktop application that helps users manage their finances. It keeps track of the financial
transactions the user undertakes. The primary target audience of this application is Small and Medium Entreprises (SMEs) in Singapore since
they typically face budget constraints and have to maintain a good credit score. However, this application can also be used by individuals
who may want to maintain a database of their personal transactions.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *an interest calculation feature*
** What it does: allows the user to obtain the final amount that needs to be payed after calculating the interest on the principal sum of each
                 transaction on a monthly basis, using either the simple or the compound interest scheme.
** Justification: Providing an in-built feature to calculate interests is essential since loans are usually charged the market interest rate and the user
                  needs to be aware of the final sum of the money owed or lent before the deadline.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *a currency conversion utility* within the application
** What it does: allows the user to convert amounts in different currencies to their respective amounts in the base currency, Singapore Dollars
** Justification: This feature provides users the flexibility to transact with people from different countries and saves them the hassle of using a 3rd party software to convert the amounts for each transaction.
** Highlights: The implementation makes use of a free external foreign exchange API, provided by https://free.currencyconverterapi.com[Free Currency Converter API] that updates every hour according to the latest currency trends.
               Since the API is JSON-based, the more time consuming portion of adding the command was using the right library to parse the information
               in an appropriate format.
